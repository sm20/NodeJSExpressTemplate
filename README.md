# ExpressNodeJSTemplate

Created Using Visual Studio Code template: NodeJS Express 4 (JavaScript version)

Note: On Visual Studio startup, select 'Open a Project or Solution', and then select the .sln file associated with the project. This allows for the project to be opened up as a solution rather than a folder.
